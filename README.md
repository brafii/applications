# applications

NB:
A mini project for assessment.<br>
Languages used: Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap<br><br>

What the application does is when you click on the plus button it will display the next card to open the dashboard.<br><br>

I was trying to create a fake API call to fetch data and display it on the card but i was having challenges.<br>
So i decided to hardcode it.<br>

I used vanilla js because i feel comfortable coding in that plus im still growing in react js
